            <p> There are ‘two basic morals’ that exist according to the Bits author. The first one is technology is neither good or bad. The second is that new technology brings social change which brings both risks and opportunities. A good citizen uses the internet wisely and respectfully toward others. You have to be cautious about what you send to other people and how you treat them because the internet is permanent. There are endless things on the internet and we should be using it in a beneficial way like research. Technology is growing fast so it’s very important we use it in a positive way and not negative.
