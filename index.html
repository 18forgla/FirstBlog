            Two Morals
          </div>
          <div class="split-bio">
            <p> There are ‘two basic morals’ that exist according to the Bits author. The first one is technology is neither good or bad. The second is that new technology brings social change which brings both risks and opportunities. A good citizen uses the internet wisely and respectfully toward others. You have to be cautious about what you send to other people and how you treat them because the internet is permanent. There are endless things on the internet and we should be using it in a beneficial way like research. Technology is growing fast so it’s very important we use it in a positive way and not negative.

            Underwater Video System
          </div>
          <div class="split-bio">
            <p> In the article “No Strings Attached for Underwater Video System,” it talks about the wireless high-quality live video streams that are happening underwater. The researchers at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) say that the new technology that they have created allow “the potential to open the oceans to further exploration and monitoring.” Ph.D. student Abdullah Al-Halafi, improved off of already existing technologies by exploring underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) systems, which consume significantly less power and offer the higher bandwidths required for streaming live video. The team went through many tests and algorithms by passing signals through different types of water to get the best quality of video. The videos are also more helpful when it comes to water maintenance of underwater pipelines for gases and oils, especially when it becomes too costly to use divers or the water levels aren’t high enough for remote control vehicles. With that being said will these new video streams affect the jobs of divers if they are no longer as useful? Considering that the ocean takes up such a large percentage of our planet this is great news! With them, there will hopefully be great new discoveries being made all the time.
